# Magic Wand Enclosure Design
## Design Concept
This magic wand isn't just a tool for gestures—it’s a statement. By reimagining everyday, disposable materials as a platform for magical interactions, I play with the idea that magic can be hidden in plain sight, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary.

## Materials & Sustainability
Enclosure Base: Recycled milkshake cup
Wand Handle: Reused plastic straw

These were selected for:
- Accessibility – Everyday items, easy to find or repurpose
- Sustainability – Emphasizing reuse over consumption
- Playfulness – Nods to childhood joy and simplicity
By using discarded food packaging, the wand not only performs digital magic, it reflects environmental responsibility.

## Design Decisions
- Surprise Factor:
The wand emerges from a milkshake cup. At first glance, it looks like leftover fast food waste—until it lights up and starts classifying gestures! This unexpected transformation captures the surprise and delight often associated with magic.
- Symbolic Form:
The straw as a wand handle subtly plays on the idea of childhood creativity—when anything, even a straw, could become a sword, a telescope, or a wand. The milkshake cup acts as both a stand and a cloak, reinforcing the idea of "magic in disguise."
- Everyday Magic:
This design reminds users that magic doesn't have to be flashy. It exists in everyday moments: in reuse, in play, in small wonders. Our wand isn’t from a fantasy world—it’s from our world.
